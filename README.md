# IW4
Raw MW2 .GSC files and .MENU files. No FastFiles.


# Raw Files
Raw files are the code snippets that make up the game's basic logic. These are the .GSC files inside of the CoD series'
custom archive format, FastFile. 

# Menu Files
Menu files make up a large portion of what you see in the main menus in Call of Duty. They can be modded in CoD4 along with
other CoDs.

# What is not included?
FastFiles and maps. The archives are big and the map archives don't have a large code base.
